This piece of code is by no means my own, however, I grew tired of having to download, copy and paste this library between my projects.

Thus I'm hosting it on my Github account :)

For those of you whom are not familiar with the event, it works like so.

$('element').addEvent('outerClick',function() {
  //The user has clicked (outside) of the given element
});

This event is useful for managing when an element is displaying itself, but the user wishes to blur it from his/her view.
